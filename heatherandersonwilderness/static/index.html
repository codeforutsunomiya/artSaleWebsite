		<h3>John Muir Wilderness</h3>
			<div class="park">
			<div class="painting"><p>Red Slate Mountain</p><a href="images/Red Slate Mountain.jpg" data-lightbox="John Muir Wilderness" data-title="Red Slate Mountain - My honeymoon with Bob in ’97 featured great mountains, camp, and weather in our High Sierra. We had chilly dips in alpine lakes and streams, with lovely gardens of heather, onion, penstemon, mint, shooting stars and yarrow all around. At night a brilliant Milky Way lit the sky. This area had much red, metamorphic rock. We didn’t climb the mountain because of an icy slope, only the pass between McGee Lakes and Hopkins Creek, ending with a relaxing soak in Mammoth Hot Springs."><img src="images/Red Slate Mountain.jpg" alt="Red Slate Mountain painting"></a><p>$800</p></div>
			<div class="painting"><p>Seven Gables</p><a href="images/Seven Gables.jpg" data-lightbox="John Muir Wilderness" data-title="Seven Gables - Rachel, Erma and I took the shuttle across Florence Lake while our packs were spot-dropped into the Sallie Keyes Lakes, where we camped. After getting knee replacements I was no longer strong enough to shoulder a heavy pack. The next day we dipped in Marie Lake, then hiked on to Sandpiper Lake for our base camp. Sipping after-dinner Sierra tea, while watching alpenglow on the high peaks, was a wonderfully relaxing prelude to our hike up Seven Gables the next day. It was a hard, rock-hopping climb, but not difficult; the top was our reward. Walking back out to Florence Lake, we relaxed in a small hot spring before bidding farewell to the Range of Light.

			<div class="painting"><p>Spring Lake Basin</p><a href="images/Spring Lake Basin.jpg" data-lightbox="John Muir Wilderness" data-title="Spring Lake Basin - Spring Lake was our first campsite on one trip and I had come down with a case of altitude sickness, which is cured by a day in the sack. I was grateful to be able to get up about dinner time, eat a little, and sketch the lovely basin above us."><img src="images/Spring Lake Basin.jpg" alt="Spring Lake Basin painting"></a><p>$700</p></div>
			<div class="painting"><p>Mount Crocker</p><a href="images/no-image.png" data-lightbox="John Muir Wilderness" data-title="Mount Crocker - (Charles Crocker, 1822–1888, financier. Beautiful Pioneer Basin, with grand mountains all around, was named after the four pioneer railroad builders — Crocker, Hopkins, Huntington, and Stanford.) After Rachel and I enjoyed the 360 degree view atop Mt. Crocker, we descending, by a different trail, about 10 inches wide, with an edge sloping downward above thousands of feet of air. I was so grateful to find wide solid rock again for our lunch site. We climbed Mt. Hopkins, then attempted Mt. Huntington, but near the top lightning and thunder erupted.  Not wanting to get electrocuted, we headed back in a downpour for a few forced hours in our tent."><img src="images/noimage.png" alt="Mount Crocker painting"></a><p>$500</p></div>

		<h3>Kings Canyon National Park Wilderness</h3>
		<div class="park">
			<div class="painting"><p>Kearsarge Cutoff</p><a href="images/Kearsarge Cutoff.jpg" data-lightbox="Kings Canyon National Park Wilderness" data-title="Kearsarge Cutoff - Short cuts often are longer and harder than the original marked trail. My husband decided this route was a more direct way to Rae Lakes. It was not. When I looked over the pass, I saw that it was very steep and icy, and we had a four-year-old with us. I promised to never again doubt if we could all just get safely down.  We descended cautiously in the couloir’s narrow space between snow and granite side walls and also stamped footings in the snow. As we got onto the talus, there was still much rock-hopping left to do. Hungry, tired, and grateful, we finally found a campsite."><img src="images/Kearsarge Cutoff.jpg" alt="Kearsarge Cutoff painting"></a><p>$500</p></div>
			<div class="painting"><p>Mount Agassiz</p><a href="images/Mount Agassiz.jpg" data-lightbox="Kings Canyon National Park Wilderness" data-title="Mount Agassiz - (Louis Agassiz, 1807–1873, naturalist, geologist, professor of zoology at Harvard.Following on the studies of other scientists, Agassiz was the first to propose the existence of a past ice age.) In ’79, Rachel and I cached our packs at Bishop Pass and took the fairly long, arduous spur trail leading to Mt. Agassiz, reaching the top by 3pm. After a 6pm lunch at the pass, we cut off the main trail into Dusy Basin, staying high to camp by a lovely alpine lake for a cozy, warm sleep. Climbing again in 2010, Phyllis and I had a glorious camp in the upper basin, just west of Bishop Pass. Camps always include dipping in a chilly Sierra lake, since coming out is so exhilarating. On the last morning, cold, cloudy, and windy, as darkness began to disperse, gorgeous reds, oranges, and yellows streaked the eastern sky, and the 7:40 sun came up through the clouds between Mt. Agassiz and Mt. Winchell. What a celebration."><img src="images/Mount Agassiz.jpg" alt="Mount Agassiz painting"></a><p>$800</p></div>
			<div class="painting"><p>Palisades I (yellow)</p><a href="images/Palisades 1.jpg" data-lightbox="Kings Canyon National Park Wilderness" data-title="Palisades I (yellow) - (Edward Sill, 1841–1887, poet, English teacher in Oakland public schools, professor of English, UC Berkeley.) The Palisades are a climbers’ mecca. From camp, Rachel and I went up Mount Sill, the second highest peak of this impressive group. On top, we were surprised to hear a voice. It was a climber on the cliff-side just reaching over the top to join us; we had only hiked over rocks to the top."><img src="images/Palisades 1.jpg" alt="Palisades I (yellow) painting"></a><p>$800</p></div>

After lunch, we took photos and descended, via Frog Lake, to a campsite. (No camping at Frog.)"><img src="images/Rachel on Kearsarge Pass.jpg" alt="Rachel on Kearsarge Pass painting"></a><p>not for sale</p></div>
			<div class="painting"><p>Southfork Pass</p><a href="images/Southfork Pass.jpg" data-lightbox="Kings Canyon National Park Wilderness" data-title="Southfork Pass - We came down the pass in ’79, a knapsack route between the south fork of Big Pine Creek and the Muir Trail. Knapsack means it is possible, though not a trail.  I would not like to do it again."><img src="images/Southfork Pass.jpg" alt="Southfork Pass painting"></a><p>$500</p></div>

		<h3>Sequoia National Park Wilderness</h3>
		<div class="park">
			<div class="painting"><p>Moose Lake (diptych)</p><a href="images/Moose Lake 1.jpg" data-lightbox="Sequoia National Park Wilderness" data-title="Moose Lake I (ditych) - The second campsite of our 1950 wedding trip was Moose Lake. It is a tarn, an isolated lake with mountains on three sides and an outlet off the fourth from the small lake. I gathered a few twigs to heat our staple of split-pea soup. Later, an indigo sky held a billion bright stars amongst the wide sweep of the Milky Way."><img src="images/Moose Lake 1.jpg" alt="Moose Lake (ditych) first of two paintings"></a></div>

Before founding the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Langley led the 1881 expedition to the summit of nearby Mount Whitney to conduct experiments in solar heat.) Before this trip we had never been so far south in the Sierra. On the first day my son, Ben, wanted to climb the peak.  We did not make it; I felt one more day was needed to safely acclimatize. There was, however, time to sketch, checking out the peaks, ridges, and valleys. A large Boy Scout troop camped near us and I watched as two patient leaders attempted to teach the boys about mountain environment, gear, hiking, and camping."><img src="images/Mount Langley.jpg" alt="Mount Langley painting"></a><p>$800</p></div>
			<div class="painting"><p>Mount Whitney</p><a href="images/Mount Whitney.jpg" data-lightbox="Sequoia National Park Wilderness" data-title="Mount Whitney - (Josiah Whitney, 1819–1896, chief of the California State Geological Survey, professor of geology at Harvard. Several of the earliest explorers and climbers of the High Sierra were members of Whitney’s Survey.) Many folks make their pilgrimage to the top of Mt. Whitney and back in a single day; some camp overnight at Iceberg Lake. We made a loop, coming in over Kearsarge Pass to connect with the Muir/Pacific Crest Trail. The John Muir Trail approaches the summit along a narrow ridge which drops off sharply on both sides. Descending to Whitney Portal, I hitchhiked to Independence to retrieve the car at Onion Valley while my daughter and friend enjoyed dinner in Lone Pine."><img src="images/Mount Whitney.jpg" alt="Mount Whitney painting"></a><p>$600</p></div>
